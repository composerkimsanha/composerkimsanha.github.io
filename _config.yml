about_content: | 
  작곡가 김산하는 한국의 전통음악을 기반으로 활동하는 작곡가이다.  
  그는 전통음악의 어법과 국악기의 고유한 특성에 주목하는 동시에, 이를 전통적 문법에서 벗어나 창의적으로 활용하여 창작 음악의 지향점을 확장하는 데 집중하고 있다.  
  작곡가로서 가장 중요하게 여기는 것은 작품이 연주자와 청중 모두에게 의미를 줄 수 있어야 한다는 점이다.  
  스스로도 다시 찾아 듣고 싶은 음악을 만들기 위해 끊임없이 탐구하고 있다.

  Composer Sanha Kim is a composer working with a foundation in Korean traditional music.  
  He focuses on the idioms of traditional Korean music and the unique characteristics of its instruments,  
  while striving to creatively reinterpret them beyond conventional frameworks to expand the expressive scope of new music.  
  As a composer, he values most the creation of works that hold meaning for both performers and listeners.  
  He is continually exploring new directions to create music he would want to return to and listen to again.
